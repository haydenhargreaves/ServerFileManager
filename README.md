# Future Plans

- [ ] Move files and directories
- [ ] Delete files and directories
- [ ] Undo deleted files (using tmp files maybe, may require a DB)
- [ ] Rename files
- [ ] Dark/light mode toggle
- [ ] Image display (will require some kind of file server)
- [ ] Markdown rendering (quite a reach)

## Notes

The tmp files and undo deletion might be complicated. 

Also having some issues with file permissions, docker might be the cause.
